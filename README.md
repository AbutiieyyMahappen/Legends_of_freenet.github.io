*## **How to Use Host Tester**
Host tester is where you test if a host is working or not (e.g., `www.bnksquad.co.za`); it tells you if it's **working** or **dead**.

###**Steps:**
1. Go to **Host Tester** page
2. Enter host URL (e.g., `www.bnksquad.co.za`)
3. Click **Test**
4. Host Tester shows if host is **working** or **dead**
